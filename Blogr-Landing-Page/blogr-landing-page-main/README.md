### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Docs were the most hepful resources for TailwindCSS.
- [Traversy Media (YT)](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing Youtube Channel by Brad Traversy which helped me get started with TailwindCSS. I'd recommend it to anyone starting to learn this concept.
